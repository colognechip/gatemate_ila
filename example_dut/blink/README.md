# GateMate ILA Test: Blink

The following document illustrates the test of the embedded logic analyser developed for the GateMate FPGA and the 'blink' design under test. The test was performed on an Evaluation Board V3.1B with a CCGM1A1.

The design under test implements a PLL and synchronizes an LED to blink.

## ILA Configuration

The output of the interactive shell can be found in the file [example_output/output_ILACOP_blink.](example_output/output_ILACOP_blink)

The ILA was configured as follows:

- Number of selected bits to be analysed: 	32
- Signals under test: 
    1. **counter** [26:0]  
        The counter is incremented to the rising edge of clk0.
    2. **clk**  
        External input clock.
    3. **clk0**  
        Frequency generated by the PLL, shifted by 0 degree.
    4. **clk180**
        Frequency generated by the PLL, shifted by 180 degree.
    5. **clk270**
        Frequency generated by the PLL, shifted by 270 degree.
    6. **clk90**
        Frequency generated by the PLL, shifted by 90 degree.

- Sampling frequency: 160 MHz
- Capture duration before Trigger: Sample count = 1015, Capture duration = 6.34 us
- Capture duration after Trigger: Sample count = 1033, Capture duration = 6.45 us
